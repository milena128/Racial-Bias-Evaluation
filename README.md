# Racial-Bias-Evaluation

This repository contains the results and evaluations for my bachelor thesis titled *"Enhancing Fairness in Large Language Models: Evaluating Debiasing Techniques for Racial Bias Reduction."*

The study utilizes two distinct datasets:  
1. A multiple-choice subdataset from BBQ
2. A "why" questions subdataset from BiasLens

## File Structure

- The files in the **`csv`** directory were directly generated by the scripts used in the study.  
- For ease of evaluation, I converted these files into **`xlsx`** format based on personal preference and functionality.

## Dataset References

- **BBQ Dataset**: [BBQ Dataset on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/heegyu/bbq/viewer/Race_ethnicity)
