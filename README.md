# Racial-Bias-Evaluation

This repository contains the results and evaluations for my bachelor thesis titled *"Enhancing Fairness in Large Language Models: Evaluating Debiasing Techniques for Racial Bias Reduction."*

The study utilizes two distinct datasets:  
1. A multiple-choice dataset from **BBQ**  
2. A "why" questions dataset from **BiasLens**

## File Structure

- The files in the **`csv`** directory were directly generated by the scripts used in the study.  
- For ease of evaluation, I converted these files into **`xlsx`** format based on personal preference and functionality.
